the graphics in this collection were described with [language](https://supercollider.github.io/) meant to speak about sound. they spring from an interest in notation, linguistics and spatial linearisation of temporality.

the rules for these graphs are as simple as they are arbitrary: a string of characters turned into twenty seconds of sound turned into a square of 1024x1024 monochrome pixels.

the software used to work on these graphics is published under the MIT license. however if you would like to use one of the graphics, kindly get in touch and say hello. i will say hello in return.

welcome!
